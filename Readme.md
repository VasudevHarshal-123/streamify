Streamify Analytics Dashboard

Project Overview
The Streamify Analytics Dashboard is a single-page web application built with React, providing an interactive and visually appealing interface for analyzing key metrics of a fictional music streaming service called "Streamify." The dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as user growth, revenue, streaming data, and artist performance, along with interactive data visualizations.

Features
1. Key Metrics
Total Users: Displays the total number of registered users on the platform.
Active Users: Shows the number of users who have streamed at least one song in the last 30 days.
Total Streams: Displays the total number of song streams on the platform.
Revenue: Shows the total revenue generated from subscriptions and advertisements.
Top Artist: Shows the artist with the most streams in the past 30 days.
2. Data Visualizations
User Growth Chart: A line chart showing the growth in the number of total users and active users over the past 12 months.
Revenue Distribution: A pie chart that shows the breakdown of revenue from different sources (e.g., Subscriptions, Ads).
Top 5 Streamed Songs: A bar chart that displays the top 5 most-streamed songs over the past 30 days.
Monthly Active Users (MAU) vs Daily Active Users (DAU): Displays a comparison between MAU and DAU over a 12-month period.
Revenue by Country/Region: A breakdown of revenue generated by country/region.
3. Data Table
A sortable and filterable data table that lists detailed information about recent streams, including:
Song Name
Artist
Date Streamed
Stream Count
User ID
Sorting and filtering options allow users to sort by date or stream count, and filter by artist or song name.
4.. Dynamic Number Animation
The metrics for total users, active users, total streams, and revenue are animated to count up from 0 to their target values, providing a smooth loading experience.
Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: React.js
Styling: Custom CSS with Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout, and traditional HTML elements for structure.
Charting Library: Chart.js (used via react-chartjs-2) for rendering line, bar, and pie charts.
Icons: Custom icons are used to represent different KPIs.


How to Run the Project
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Step 2: Install Dependencies: npm install
Step 3: Start the Development Server: npm start

Future Enhancements
Real-time Data: Replace static data with dynamic, real-time data fetched from an API.
Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode toggle for the dashboard.
Advanced Filtering: Add more advanced filtering options (e.g., filter by date range, region, etc.).
User Authentication: Integrate user login to display personalized metrics.
